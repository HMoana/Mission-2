# Mission-2
Show and demonstrate an understanding the Javascript language.

Since Mission 1, I did a complete redo of my webpage. I kept the same theme, and colour palette but added a few more basic features. 
I implemented more flexbox and made the webpage more responsive. 

My Javascript implementation is rather basic, but covers all the criteria needed. I tried to focus on making the webpage simple, userfriendly, 
with subtle interactives to grab the users attention. After all, the main point of my website is for the user to follow my journey,
in order to share theres.
