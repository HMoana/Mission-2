# Mission-2
Show and demonstrate an understanding of the Javascript language.

For mission 2, I used the web page created in mission 1, but did a complete redo. I kept the same theme and colour palette, but added a few more basic features. 
Like cards and a newsletter subscription. My main focus was to implement more flexbox and responsiveness.

My Javascript implementation is rather basic, but covers all the criteria needed. I tried to focus on making the webpage simple, user-friendly, 
with subtle interactives to grab the users attention. After all, the main point of my website is for the user to follow my journey,
in order to share their own. 

What went well? 
Event listeners - click and mouse enter.
Use of if and else statements.
Use of for loop to assign attributes to elements.
Implementing style changes.

What didn't work?
The use of a loop, to loop through style changes.
Emplementing more advanced animations.
Difficulty with arthimetic equations

In general, my mission 2 is a good reflection of my understanding this far.
